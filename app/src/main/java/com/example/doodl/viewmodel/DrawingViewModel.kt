package com.example.doodl.viewmodel

// A ViewModel is a component used to store and manage UI-related data in a way that survives configuration changes
// (like screen rotations) and is independent of the UI components (e.g. Activities). They are designed to store and manage UI-related
// data and logic separately from the user interface. Acts as a bridge between the UI and the underlying data sources.

// This ViewModel will hold the drawing data and facilitate its upload to Firebase Storage,
// ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience to help keep track of users' drawings and manage the process of sending them to
// Firebase Storage without tying this logic directly into UI components, enhancing code organization and maintainability.
